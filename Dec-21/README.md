Q.1 What is a variable?
-> A container which stores the value/reference of a specific data type.
-> The value in the variable may change.

Q.2 What is a data type?
-> Type of a data.
-> Number, boolean, string, object, null, undefined, symbol, bigInt.

Q.3 Why is JS dynamically typed?
-> JS does not care about the Data type.
-> Create a variable with one data type and update with another.

Q.4 What is difference between = vs ==.
-> = is an assignment operator. That means, it assigns (saves) the value in the variable/constant.
-> == is a comparison operator. It checks whether the RHS is equal to the LHS or not.
