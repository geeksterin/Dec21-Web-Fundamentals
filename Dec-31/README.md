-> Adds extra information to the element.
-> Attributes are associated with the element.
-> They are written in the opening tag.
-> It looks like attribute_name = "attribute_value"
-> The sequence of HTML Attributes does not matter.

-> We should not have same attribute more than once in a single tag. IF we have it for any reason, then the first one will be taken into consideration and then next same attribute will be ignored!


1. Little bit of CSS. (color, margin).

<!DOCTYPE html> -> We use explicitly this to tell the browser that the document is an HTML document.

<title></title> -> Used to give title to the page. The text which is shown above the address bar.

<head></head> -> Used to contain the content which is not rendered in the viewport.

1. Style => Attribute (HTML Attribute)

CSS Style has higher priority than if same style is given using HTML attribute. (Example, text-align).

In CSS, if the same property is written more than once, then whatever is written at the last will override all values written before it. (1 of the rules of Specificity).


CSS Properties:
1. Color
2. Background Color
