- The browser (rendering engine) decides which property's value is more useful to the HTML Element.



1. Box Model
- Box model is concept which says that all renderable elements will have a Rectangular Box around it. (A box can contain other boxes inside it).

* Renderable - Dispayable. (Elements which can be rendered/dispalyed are called renderable/displayable elements.)

1. Content - It is the actual content of the element.
2. Padding - It gives space inside the box.
3. Border - It defines the edge of your box (element).
4. Margin - It is used to add space outside of your element.

margin - To give space outside of the box
padding - To give space inside of the box
border - To style the edge of the box.
