1. Introduction
-> Aayush Sinha
-> A Full Stack engineer based out of Bangalore. Working at KEMURI. (MEVN -> Mongo, Express, Vue, Node). 
-> Advanced Web.

2.Introduction to JS.

2.1 What is a programming language?
-> Medium to communicate with the computer/machine/systems.
-> A language (set of keywords) used to communicate with the machine/system/computer.

2.2 Examples of Different languages
C/C++/Java/Python/R/JavaScript/C#/Go/Cobal/PHP/F#/Ruby/Kotlin/BASH/Swift/TS/AS/Scalar/Perl/

HTML is a Programming Language?
-> NOT a programming Language -> Hyper Text Markup Language.

(Machine understandable) Low Level Language / High Level Language
-> Assembly Level language -> Understandable by the processor.
-> We write High Level language.

2.3 What is the difference between a programming language and a pseudo code?
-> Pseudo means fake/false.
-> Pseudo code is in english (basically used for communicating between humans).
-> Programming langauge -> Human <-> Machine.

2.4 Broadly classified into Two types -> Compiled and Interpreted.
-> In compiled -> The syntax is checked first and the code is compiled into a smaller (optimized) file. Then that file is executed.
-> If there is a syntax error, the program will not compile only.

-> In interpreted -> The execution and the syntax check happens line by line (1 after the other).
-> It will execute upto the line of error and then it will crash.

-> Compiled languages are comparatively faster.

Compiled -> C, C++, C#, Java, COBOL.
Interpreted -> Python, PHP, Javascript, TS.

Is JS compiled or interpreted?
-> Interpreted.

What is a thread in programming?
What are threads?
-> A single independent process which is executed by the processor.

Multi threaded -> Java

Is Javascript single Threaded or Multi Threaded?
-> Single Threaded. Means, at a given point in time. A single step of execution will be done. It might look that it is executing parallely, but it is not.

Q. What is a program?
-> Set of steps/commands/intructions to be followed by the machine.
-> To perform a specific task.

Q. What is an instruction?
-> An order to execute.
-> A command to execute.
-> A single step to be executed by the machine.

1. JavaScript -> It is a scripting language.
-> All of interpreted languages are scripting languages.



2. Write a hello world in JS.
-> https://jsfiddle.net/
-> https://codepen.io/

Write HTML and JS files ✔
-> To see the JS, we have to open the Developer console.
1. Right Click > Inspect.
2. Three Dots/Line > More > Show Developer Console.
3. Shift + Control/Command + I/U/J
4. F12 (Fn + F12).


What is a variable?
-> Memory location where the value can change during execution.
-> It's like a container to store and refer the value.

In order to create a variable. We write "var" keyword followed by the variable name. (It can contain Alphabets, Numbers and underscore). It should start with an alphabet.

Assignment operator (=) -> Used to save the value.


What is data?
-> A piece/collection of information.

Data Types (JS)
-> Int -> Number ✔
-> Char ❌
-> Double ❌
-> Boolean ✔ 
-> Float ❌
-> String ✔
-> Array ❌
-> List ❌
-> Collection ❌
-> Tuple ❌
-> Dictionary ❌
-> Enumeration ❌
-> Pointer ❌
-> Set ❌
-> Object ✔
-> Stack ❌
-> Queue ❌
-> Long -> BigInt ✔
-> Short ❌
-> varchar ❌
-> timestamp ❌
-> Null / void ✔
-> undefined ✔


JS Data types:
1. Boolean
2. Number
3. String
4. BigInt
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Object ✔
8. Symbol


1. Difference between Data type and Data Structure
-> Type of the data. 
-> How it is organized. (How am i storing it).

1. String Data Type -> A collection of characters represented between quotes.


10. JS is a loosely/dynamically typed Scripting Language.
It does not care about the data types. We can create a variable with a different data type and then later update the variable with a different data type.

10.5 Single Line comment -> double slash //

11. Comparison. (Decision box). Check for if (keyword) the condition is true, execute the commands written within the curly brackets, otherwise (else, keyword) execute other commands in curly brackets.

Assignment:
Q1. Write a program to check whether the number is greater than 10 or not.
Q2. Write a program to have 3 variables (all three are number) and output the highest/greatest/maximum of all three.
