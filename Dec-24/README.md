Q1. How do we write a for loop?
-> initialization
-> condition
-> increment / decrement

Q4. Is JS a scripting language or a programming language?
1. Scripting ❌
2. Programming ✔
3. Something else.- Both because all scripting languages are programming languages. ✔

1. Loops (while, do while, for of, for in).
-> While is an entry controlled loop. It will check the condition before executing.
-> do while is exit controlled loop. It will check the condition after executing. do while will ALWAYS execute ATLEAST 1 time.

2. functions.

1. Fibonacci series.
2. Pattern printing.

-> Using an IDE and it's extensions.
