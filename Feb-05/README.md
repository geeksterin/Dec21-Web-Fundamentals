1. Promises:
Q. What is Promises?
-> It is a part of asynchronous programming. The result is NOT evaluated immediately. Possible usecase. (Fetching some data from the server, waiting for input, fetching the data from Database)
-> A promise object is returned.
-> A promise has 3 states (Pending -> Default, Resolved -> Success, Rejected -> Failure).
-> During Resolve and Reject, we can pass some arguments also, those arguments can be take in the callback parameter.

2. fetch
-> Fetching the data from the server.
-> It returns a promise.
-> We can use .then chaining.
