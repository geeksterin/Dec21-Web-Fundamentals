1. We are currently on HTML 5.

2. Give comments.
Q. What are comments?
-> Used to documentation
-> Piece of code not executed.
-> The browser will ignore
-> The statements which will be ignored.
-> It is for understanding of humans.
-> Machines will not parse (reder, execute) this.
-> Descript the code for better understanding.

-> It is a piece of text written in the code which will not be parsed by the machine. It is for better understanding of the engineers (humans basically)!



Q. What is a table?
-> Tablular representation of data.
-> Combination of rows and columns.
-> Used to show structured data.


1. In HTML. To add a comment.

1. Alot of more tags:
-> anchor tag. -> <a></a> -> Used to navigate between different pages on the internet.
-> div tag. -> <div></div> -> Used to divide the whole page and keep elements in a boxed container. (If we shift the box, then the elements inside will also be shifted).

-> Layout Tags (header, footer, aside, nav, section). -> Helps in code readability. Instead of using div as a container. For main sections/parts of your webpage, use the laytout tags.

-> span. -> <span></span> -> By default, it does not have any style of it's own. Like generic container for text.

-> button. -> <button></button> -> Creates a button which can be clicked by the user.

-> table (td th tr)
--> table -> Used to create a container for the whole table.
--> thead -> Used to create a container for the heading of the table.
--> tbody -> Used to create a container for the body of the table.
--> tfoot -> Used to create a container for the footer of the table.
--> tr -> Used to create a new ROW.
--> th -> Used to create a new cell which is of a heading style.
--> td -> Used to create a new cell which is of a typical paragraph style.

--> colspan
--> rowspan
